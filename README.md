## Known Bugs

<strike>Mipha's Grace will still make `tryUseTotem` return false, registering the player as dead and as such increase stats and drop items/XP whether or not they have Mipha's Grace in their inventory. Pressing `Respawn` will simply get rid of the overlay and allow the player to continue on.</strike> This bug has been fixed as of november 2023. No official build contains this bug.
